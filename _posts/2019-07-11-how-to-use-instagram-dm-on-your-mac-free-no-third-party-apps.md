description: Using Instagram DM safely and easily on your Mac (for free!!)

Have you ever wanted to continue a conversation on Instagram DM but found it frustrating to pick up and unlock your phone everytime? People sliding into your DM's but you're supposed to be, in air quotes, *focused* on work? 

It's unfortunate that, as of today, Instagram has no official app for Mac. Yeah, you could use the website through your browser but what's the fun in scrolling through and liking posts without being able to message people. For whatever reason, Windows has a native app of its own but Mac doesn't. That said, there are a few third-party apps that exist, although I've steered away from those because I'd rather not give them access to my password, posts, usage activity, messages, and the like (pun intended). 

I've written this tutorial to show how anyone on a Mac can set up Instagram DM in 60 seconds (if you're good at following instructions), without worrying about their data or spending money.

Requirements: Mac, internet connection.

**Launch Automator**

You can do this by searching for 'Automator' on spotlight (quick launch by holding *command + space*). You could also look for it in your applications, it's an icon of a robot, normally in the defualt 'Other' folder.

I was  surprised this solution didn't exist already, so I did some digging. I found that Instagram only recently (mid-May) enabled DM on mobile browsers, which is exactly the trick this solution uses. It also looks like you'll soon be able to [access Instagram for web for all devices](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/instagram-direct-desktop/). Yes, that would make this trick a little redundant, but I've found that being able to launch a mobile-sized application in one click is easier than using Instagram in my browser.
