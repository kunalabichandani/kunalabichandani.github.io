            Young people are often told “you can’t”. Kunal Abichandani, a student at the University of Pennsylvania, interviews GenZers who share their stories of overcoming the age barrier, doing cool things, and making an impact. Whether you’re looking for inspiration to do what people think you can’t, learn from others’ experiences, or just curious to learn about what’s popping, this is the podcast for you.
