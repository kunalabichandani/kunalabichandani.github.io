### About 
I'm an engineer + designer. I love creating things (and thinking about things to create 💭). 
<br/><br/>
In May 2022, I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, where I double majored in Computer Science 💻 and Design 🎨. Among other things, I'm passionate about studying the broader impact of technology on society + human behavior 🧑‍🤝‍🧑, cracking dad jokes 🥸, and contemplating how I can make the most of my time in this life 🌏.
<br/><br/>
Some highlights of my past experiences include: 
- Solving core infrastructure challenges at Facebook (TPM Intern, Summer 2021)
- Building companies and products from 0 -> 1 at <a href="https://atomic.vc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomic</a> (SWE/PM Intern, Summer 2020)
- Co-founding and scaling Penn's first and only co-ed entrepreneurship frat, <a href="https://www.pennsep.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sigma Eta Pi</a>
