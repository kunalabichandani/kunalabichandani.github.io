### About 
I'm an engineer and designer, and I love creating things (or thinking about things to create).
<br/><br/>
Currently, I'm a senior at the University of Pennsylvania where I'm pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Design.
<br/><br/>
I'm passionate about problems (and solutions) in education, future of work, sustainability, and the broader impact of technology in society and mental health. 
<br/><br/>
Some of the things I've worked on in the past include: 
- Solving core infrastructure challenges at Facebook (TPM Intern, Summer 2021)
- Building companies and products from 0 -> 1 at <a href="https:/atomic.vc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomic</a> (SWE/PM Intern, Summer 2020)
- Co-founding and scaling Penn's first and only co-ed entrepreneurship frat, <a href="https:/www.pennsep.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sigma Eta Pi</a>
- Creating startup communities as a Venture Fellow at .406 / Unshackled / Ripple VC
- Writing code to extract + understand data at Health Sensei (SWE Intern, Summer 2019)
