### Favorite classes at Penn
Between my majors (and the entrepreneurship minor I dropped with one class remaining), I took a lot of different classes at Penn. Here are some of my absolute favorites that pushed me as a person and make a big part of who I am today.
<br>
<br>

#### RELS 256 (Existential Despair) / Justin McDaniel
7 hour class that met once a week from the afternoon till midnight, taught by a former monk. We'd read a new (surprise) book cover to cover every class, exploring themes of trauma and existental despair. Fun <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-this-college-professor-is-teaching-a-7-hour-class-on-existential-despair_n_5903a9fae4b02655f83d7f03" target="_blank">article</a> written about the class.
<br>
<br>

#### DSGN 269 (Typography) / Sharka Hayland
Class about the theory and history of letterforms, along with the origins of typefaces. Taught me about the intentionality in our world that we often take for granted.
<br>
<br>

#### NETS 150 (Market & Social Systems on the Internet) / Swapneel Sheth
Class that explored some of the basic systems underlying the internet, such as search engines / algorithms and recommendation models. TA'd for 3 years.
<br>
<br>

#### DSGN 306 (Design 21: Design After the Digital) / Orkan Telhan
Interdisciplinary class that explored the role of design in the 21st century, and how it integrates with science and technology. Convinced me to pursue a second major in Design.
